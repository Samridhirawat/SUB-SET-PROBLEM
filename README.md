# SUBSET Selection Problem

Problem Statment:


. Find all the subset from a set of number whose sum is zero 

. Constraint subset size must be 5 

. Set ={-12,-3,-6,7,-2,2,6,3,9,-7,-5,-8,1,11,-9,-4}


# problem statement:


.find all the subset from a set of number whose sum is zero.

.COnstraint: Subset size must be 3 to 6 only  

. set = {-12,-3,-6,7,2,-2,6,3,9,-7,-5,-8,1,11,-9,-4}
